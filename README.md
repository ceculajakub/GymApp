# GymApp V1
(still in progress) Project of app created for gym users to help them report and track their progress. At the beginning it was a group project, but now I'm the only 
one updating code. It's an early stage version of this app and it helps me to really get to know what I'm learning from books and courses. 

I'm coding in Visual Studio 2022, mainly C#. Recently I'm getting to know Entity Framework and whole REST API concept. It's also my first project in which I'm not getting data from single files and I'm working with database and using LINQ.
